# DRM_PIP_DEMO

Video streaming app using SwiftUI and MVVM architecture, integrating:
✅ HLS Streaming for smooth playback
✅ Picture-in-Picture (PiP) Mode for a YouTube-like experience
✅ FairPlay DRM to prevent screen recording & screenshots (Check with Physical Device)
✅ Dynamic UI with a floating, draggable PiP window
✅ REST API Integration fetching free videos from Pexels

This project was a deep dive into iOS video player customization, networking, and DRM security. The PiP feature lets users keep watching while browsing the app, and DRM ensures content protection just like Netflix & Prime Video!
